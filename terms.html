          <h2>1. Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing or using the WEMIR Systems website (the “Site”), you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”).
            If you do not agree, do not use the Site.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Services and Information</h2>
          <p>
            WEMIR Systems provides website upgrade and automation consulting, including AI tool integrations (“Services”).
            Any descriptions, examples, demos, or pricing shown on the Site are provided for informational purposes and may change.
            A final scope, timeline, and deliverables are confirmed in writing before work begins.
          </p>

          <h2>3. No Professional Advice</h2>
          <p>
            Content on the Site is general information and does not constitute legal, financial, medical, or other professional advice.
            You are responsible for obtaining appropriate professional guidance for your situation.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Intake Submissions</h2>
          <p>
            When you submit information through an intake form, you represent that the information is accurate to the best of your knowledge.
            Intake submissions do not create a client relationship or guarantee Services.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The Site, its visual design, branding, text, and code are owned by WEMIR SOLUTIONS or licensed for use, and are protected by applicable laws.
            You may not copy, reproduce, or distribute Site content without permission, except as allowed by law.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Third-Party Tools and Platforms</h2>
          <p>
            Some upgrades may involve third-party platforms (e.g., hosting providers, CRMs, analytics tools, automation platforms, AI services).
            WEMIR Systems is not responsible for third-party outages, policy changes, pricing changes, or platform limitations.
            You are responsible for maintaining your own accounts and complying with third-party terms.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Security and API Keys</h2>
          <p>
            For static hosting (like GitHub Pages), private keys should not be placed in front-end code.
            If your project requires secure server-side calls, we may recommend a backend deployment (e.g., Vercel/Netlify).
            You are responsible for keeping credentials confidential and rotating them if exposed.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
          <p>
            The Site and any demos are provided “as is” and “as available.” We disclaim all warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law,
            including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, WEMIR Systems will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages,
            or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill arising from your use of the Site or reliance on Site content.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. Your continued use of the Site after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Contact</h2>
          <p>
            For questions about these Terms, use the <a href="intake.html">intake page</a> or contact us through the channel provided during your project discussions.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
            If you want a stricter set of terms (refunds, payment terms, deliverables, SLAs), that should be a separate “Service Agreement” for paying clients.
